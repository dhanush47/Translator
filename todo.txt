println - handle stuff like 'println("hi" + a + "hey")' as 'cout << "hi" << a << "hey"' rather than 'cout << "hi + a + "hey"'

classes - handle inheritance/extends/implements ??

handle arrays - declarations

ASGN still not working. FIX THIS !!!

If the primary (public) class has only one method (main method), then remove the class construct and rename the main method as 'void main()' (OR) PrimaryClass.main()

println -> print '\n' also

import something.java.IO -> #include<iostream>

"using namespace std;" -> what about this?


IMPORTANT:
- System.out.println("whatever" + " and all"); 
	handle these so that "\n" can be added into Java code
	(gotta modify stuff in lex file so that double quotes for strings can be handled)
